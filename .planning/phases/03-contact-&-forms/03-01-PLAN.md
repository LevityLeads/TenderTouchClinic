  <name>Task 1: Create contact data file and map embed component</name>
  <files>src/data/contact.ts, src/components/sections/map-embed.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Create `src/data/contact.ts` with typed contact information:

  ```typescript
  export const contactInfo = {
    phone: "083 564 1671",
    email: "tendertouch.ct@gmail.com",
    whatsapp: "27835641671", // Format for WhatsApp link
    address: {
      street: "13 Nederburg Road",
      suburb: "Kirstenhof",
      city: "Cape Town",
      full: "13 Nederburg Road, Kirstenhof, Cape Town"
    }
  };

  export const businessHours = [
    { day: "Monday", hours: "8:00 AM - 5:00 PM" },
    { day: "Tuesday", hours: "8:00 AM - 5:00 PM" },
    { day: "Wednesday", hours: "8:00 AM - 5:00 PM" },
    { day: "Thursday", hours: "8:00 AM - 5:00 PM" },
    { day: "Friday", hours: "8:00 AM - 5:00 PM" },
    { day: "Saturday", hours: "Closed" },
    { day: "Sunday", hours: "Closed" },
  ];

  export const directions = {
    bycar: "From the M3, take the Tokai exit onto Spaanschemat River Road. Continue for approximately 2km, then turn right onto Kirstenhof Road. Take the second left onto Nederburg Road. The clinic is on the right-hand side.",
    parking: "Free parking available directly in front of the clinic. Additional street parking on Nederburg Road.",
    publicTransport: "The nearest MyCiti bus stop is on Main Road, Retreat, approximately 1.5km from the clinic."
  };
  ```

  Create `src/components/sections/map-embed.tsx` as a Server Component:
  - Accept `address` and optional `title` props
  - Use Google Maps Embed API URL format: `https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=${API_KEY}&q=${encodedAddress}`
  - For now, use a placeholder URL without API key (will add env var later): `https://www.google.com/maps?q=${encodedAddress}&output=embed`
  - Wrap iframe in responsive container with `aspect-[16/9] min-h-[300px]`
  - Add `loading="lazy"` for performance
  - Add `referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"` for API compatibility
  - Add proper title for accessibility

  <done>Contact data file exports contactInfo, businessHours, and directions. MapEmbed component renders responsive iframe.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Create contact info component and contact page</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/contact-info.tsx, src/app/contact/page.tsx</files>

  - Display business hours with Clock icon
  - Use Tailwind grid layout: single column on mobile, 2 columns on md+

  Create `src/app/contact/page.tsx`:
  - Export metadata with title "Contact Us | Tender Touch Mother & Baby Clinic"
  - Description for SEO: "Get in touch with Tender Touch clinic..."
  - Use Section component with variants for visual hierarchy
  - Hero section: Heading "Get in Touch", subheading about contacting the clinic
  - Contact info section: Render ContactInfo component
