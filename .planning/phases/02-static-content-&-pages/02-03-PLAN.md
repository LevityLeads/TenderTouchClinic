<objective>
Create the About, Schedule, FAQ, and legal pages to complete the static content phase.

Purpose: Complete the visitor information journey by providing Megan's background and credentials (building trust), upcoming class dates with availability (enabling booking decisions), FAQ answers (reducing inquiry friction), and required legal pages.

Output: 5 page routes (about, schedule, faq, privacy, terms) with supporting section components.
