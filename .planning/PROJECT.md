- **Third-party integration**: Must integrate with Bookem booking system — Existing booking platform in use

- **Contact channels**: Phone, email, WhatsApp — Multiple ways to reach out based on user preference

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Modern framework over CMS | User wants cutting-edge, fast, smooth experience; content rarely updated so WordPress/CMS overhead not needed | — Pending |
| Bookem for booking | Existing system in use and working; prefer embedded widget over external link for seamless experience | — Pending |
| Two clear visitor journeys | Mix of prenatal and postnatal clients need different information quickly — home page must serve both paths | — Pending |
| Real photos over stock | Authentic clinic and class photos build trust better than generic stock imagery | — Pending |
| Mobile-first approach | Target audience (new and expectant mothers) primarily browse on phones, often with baby in arms | — Pending |
