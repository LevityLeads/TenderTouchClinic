  bio: `With over 25 years of nursing experience and as a mother of two teenagers, I understand the joys and challenges of parenthood firsthand.

After years of providing postnatal home visits, I opened Tender Touch Mother & Baby Clinic in January 2022 to create a warm, welcoming space where mothers can find the support they need.

My approach combines evidence-based care with genuine warmth and understanding. I believe every mother deserves personalized attention, which is why I keep my classes small and my consultations unhurried.

Whether you're preparing for birth, navigating the early weeks with your newborn, or looking for ongoing support, I'm here to help you feel confident and cared for.`,
